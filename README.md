# KeyCapture-Python

**KeyCapture-Python** is an interesting Python project that allows you to create an executable keylogger, compile it into an executable (.exe) for Windows or Linux, and even add your own icon. Please use this tool responsibly and for educational purposes only.

## Introduction

This Python tool provides a convenient way to create a keylogger, compile it into an executable, and add your own icon. Keyloggers have legitimate use cases, such as monitoring your own computer, but they can also be misused. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and adhere to all legal and ethical guidelines when using or distributing keyloggers.

## Features

- Create a keylogger in Python.
- Compile the keylogger into an executable file (.exe).
- Add a custom icon to your compiled keylogger.
- Easy-to-use and interactive console interface.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `Key.py` file.
3. Follow the prompts to set a token and time interval for keylogging.
4. Choose whether to compile the keylogger into an executable.
5. If compiling, decide whether to add a custom icon to the executable.

**Note:** This tool is intended for educational purposes, and its use should comply with all legal and ethical standards.

## Compilation

The tool allows you to compile the Python keylogger into an executable. You can choose whether to add a custom icon to the executable. The compilation process is platform-specific:

- For Windows: It uses `pyinstaller` to create a Windows executable (.exe).
- For Linux: It uses `wine` and `pyinstaller` to create a Linux executable.

## Disclaimer

The use of keyloggers for any malicious or unauthorized activities is strictly prohibited. Always obtain proper authorization and ensure that you comply with all legal and ethical standards when using keyloggers.
